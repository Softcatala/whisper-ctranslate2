Like most predator mammals, the fox has powerful muscles, a cardiovascular system that allows a high speed and great resistance and teeth to hunt, endure and break prey.
The ancestral skeleton of the foxes allows them to run and jump. Their spores have developed to quickly push them forward, jumping when necessary to hunt and catch prey.
